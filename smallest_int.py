Task:
Write a function that, given a list of integers A, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

Examples:

A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2] â†’ returns 5


A = [1, 2, 3] â†’ returns 4

A = [-1, -3] â†’ returns 1

Constraints:
N (length of A) can be up to 100,000

Elements can be negative, zero, or positive


Problem 1: Missing Integer

Goal:
- Find the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not appear in the input array A.

Approach:
1. Minimize the number of times we pass through the array.
2. Convert the array into a set for O(1) membership checks.
3. Start checking integers from 1 upward.
4. Return the first integer that is not in the set.

Rationale:
- Using a set allows us to check for missing numbers efficiently without sorting.
- Incrementing from 1 ensures we find the smallest missing positive integer.
- This approach is O(n) time and O(n) space, suitable for large arrays.

Example: A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2] â†’ returns 5


Example: A = [-1, -3] â†’ returns 1


ðŸ’¡ Hint: Use a set for O(1) lookups instead of scanning multiple times.
